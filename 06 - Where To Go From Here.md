# 6. Where To Go From Here

### Review

In this codelab, we've covered

* [Loading HTML pages in Electron BrowserWindows](https://github.com/OKStateACM/ElectronCodelab/blob/master/02%20-%20Creating%20an%20Electron%20App.md#loading-html-documents)

* [Menus](https://github.com/OKStateACM/ElectronCodelab/blob/master/03%20-%20Menus%20and%20Multi-Window%20Functionality.md#menus)

* [Interprocess communication](https://github.com/OKStateACM/ElectronCodelab/blob/master/04%20-%20Interprocess%20Communication.md#4-interprocess-communication)

* [Taskbar tray applets](https://github.com/OKStateACM/ElectronCodelab/blob/master/05%20-%20Tray%20Applets.md#trays)

In doing so, we've created a functional todo app.

### Further Tweaks

How could you improve this app? Some possible ideas include...

* Implementing file I/O so that changes aren't lost every time the app is closed

* Implementing percent complete

* Due date functionality

* [Creating an installer so users don't need to go through the command line to run your program](https://github.com/electron/windows-installer)
