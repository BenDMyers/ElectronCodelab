# Codelab: Desktop Applications with Electron

## January 24, 2018

[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is a JavaScript framework designed to allow developers to write cross-platform desktop applications using familiar web development technologies. Electron applications run in Chromium browser windows, enabling the use of HTML and CSS.

In this codelab, we'll build a functioning todo application. Users will be able to create and delete applications as they wish. Our app will live as an applet in the taskbar tray.
